Here are a few options for sharing the Gradient Loop Generator with your colleagues.

## Option 1: Short & Sweet (Best for Chat/Slack)

**Subject:** I made a gradient background generator for Google Slides! 🎨

Hey team, I built a tool to create perfectly looping animated backgrounds for our slide decks. It uses AI to generate patterns and exports optimized GIFs that won't bloat your presentation size.

## Option 2: Feature-Focused (Best for Email)

**Subject:** New Tool: Create animated gradient backgrounds for Slides 🎨✨

Hi everyone,

I wanted to share a new tool I built called **Gradient Loop**. It's designed to help us create high-quality, animated backgrounds for Google Slides without the hassle.

**What it does:**
*   **♾️ Perfect Loops:** Generates seamless animations that play forever.
*   **🤖 AI-Powered:** Describe a vibe (e.g., "calm ocean", "neon cyberpunk") and it generates the palette and movement.
*   **📉 Slide-Safe:** Includes optimization controls to keep GIF file sizes small (<50MB).
*   **🎨 Customizable:** Import colors from images or use presets.

I'd love to hear your feedback!

## Option 3: The "Maker" Vibe

**Subject:** I made a thing! Gradient Loop Generator 🌈

I got tired of static backgrounds, so I built a generator for looping gradients. It's running on React + Vite and uses Gemini to generate animation parameters on the fly.

It handles the tricky math to ensure perfect sine-wave loops and does client-side GIF encoding. Super fun to play with—give it a spin!
